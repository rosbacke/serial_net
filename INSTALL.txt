To install and use the SerialNet utility build it using cmake.

A number of prerequisites are needed. There is a tools/setup_dependencies.sh
script that will install most of them on an .deb system. It is tested
on an Ubuntu 16.04 system.

Note: The script will download and build the react-cpp library
(no .deb file is available for this). It will also request sudo priveliges to
directly install the library and include files under /usr/lib and /usr/include.
If you do not want this, don't run the script. Modify it to your liking.

To build the utility. Unpack the source. Create a parallel
folder 'serial_net-build' and build with cmake.

mkdir serial_net-build
cd serial_net-build
cmake ../serial_net
make -j 4

to run the utility:
src/mains/serialnet/serialnet --usage
